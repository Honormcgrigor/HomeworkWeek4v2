    "An outlier is an anomalous or abnormal data point, a data point that is conspicuously different from the majority of the other data points. Outliers can be because of exceptional real-life cases, but can also result from errors in data gathering or data input. For example, if surveying a group of university students, a dataset could consist of 2000 results, with 1999 of those surveyed aged between 18-28, and 1 with an age of 60. This 60 year-old would be an outlier; feasibly there could be an older student, but it is not the norm, and in this group, they are an anomaly. If the dataset consisted of the same number of students aged between 18-28, and 1 with an age of 250, this outlier could have been due to a data input error (e.g. a typo), as humans cannot age to 250. \n",
    "\n",
    "If outliers are not removed they can skew the data, and change the results of data analysis significantly. Outliers can affect results to the extent that when any conclusions drawn from a small sample and applied to a wider population will be erroneous.\n",

    "\n",
    "For those records where placeholders have been used, e.g. '?' or 'n/a', they will be replaced with 'NaN'. There are inbuilt functions to deal with NaN values - e.g. dropna, fillna. These rows with NaN can either be dropped, or replaced with a filler of the programmer's choice e.g. the mean of the column. \n",

    "In addition, data cleaning can include removing columns that are not required in the processing, or that do not have enough correct/complete data to be usable - removing columns and streamlining the dataset can make processes quicker and more efficient. \n",

    "Duplicates can alter the results, by overrepresenting certain aspects of the data which are not true to life. Essentially, when it comes to data cleaning, the phrase 'garbage in, garbage out' must be remembered.

Another real-world application of Classification are the Captcha tests that many computer users need to conduct to access certain websites.
